    "## Item 52: Know How to Break Circular Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is imported, here's what Python actually does in depth-first order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Searches for your module in locations from sys.path\n",
    "2. Loads the code from the module and ensures that it compiles\n",
    "3. Creates a corresponding empty module object\n",
    "4. Inserts the module into sys.modules\n",
    "5. Runs the code in the module object to define its contents\n",
    "\n",
    "Three ways to break circular dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reordering Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#app.py\n",
    "class Prefs(object):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "prefs = Prefs()\n",
    "\n",
    "import dialog  # Moved\n",
    "dialog.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this avoids the *AttributeError*, it goes against the PEP 8 style guide. The style guide suggests that you always put imports at the top of your Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having imports later in a file can be brittle and can cause small changes in the ordering of your code to break the module entirely. Thus, you should avoid import reordering to solve your circular dependency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import, Configure, Run\n",
    "\n",
    "The second solution to the circular imports problem is to have your modules minimize side effects at import time. You have your modules only define functions, classes, and constants. You avoid actually running any functions at import time. Then, you have each module provide a *configure* function that you call once all other modules have finished importing. The purpose of *configure* is to prepare each module's state by accessing the attributes of other modules. You run *configure* after all modules have been imported, so all attributes must be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# dialog.py\n",
    "import app\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dialog(object):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "save_dialog = Dialog()\n",
    "\n",
    "def show():\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "def configure():\n",
    "    save_dialog.save_dir = app.prefs.get('save_dir')\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# app.py\n",
    "import dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "class Prefs(object):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "prefs = Prefs()\n",
    "\n",
    "def configure():\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# main.py\n",
    "import app\n",
    "import dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "app.configure()\n",
    "dialog.configure()\n",
    "\n",
    "dialog.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well in many situations and enables patterns like *dependency injection*. But sometimes it can be difficult to structure your code so that an explicit *configure* step is possible. Having two distinct phases within a module can also make your code harder to read because it separates the definition of objects from their configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Import\n",
    "\n",
    "The third --- and often simplest --- solution to the circular imports problem is to use an *import* statement within a function or method. This is called a *dynamic import* because the module import happens while the program is running, not while the program is first starting up and initializing its modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# dialog.py\n",
    "class Dialog(object):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "save_dialog = Dialog()\n",
    "\n",
    "def show():\n",
    "    import app  # Dynamic import\n",
    "    save_dialog.save_dir = app.prefs.get('save_dir')\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's good to avoid dynamic imports like this. The cost of the *import* statement is not negligible and can be especially bad in tight loops. However, these downsides are often better than the alternative of restructuring your entire program."
