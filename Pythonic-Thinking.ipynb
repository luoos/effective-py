    "- Whitespace:\n",
    "    - Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.\n",
    "    - Use four spaces for each level of syntactically significant indenting\n",
    "    - Lines should be 79 characters in length or less\n",
    "    - Continuations of long expressions onto additional lines should be indented by **four extra** space from their normal indentation level\n",
    "    - In a file, functions and classes should be separated by **two blank lines**\n",
    "    - In a class, methods should be separated by **one blank line**\n",
    "    - Put one --- and only one --- space before and after variable assignments\n",
    "- Naming:\n",
    "    - Functions, variable and attributes should be in *lowercase_underscore* format\n",
    "    - Protected instance attributes should be in *_leading_underscore* format\n",
    "    - Private instance attributes should be in *\\__double_leading_underscore* format\n",
    "    - Classes and exceptions should be in *CapitalizedWord* format\n",
    "    - Module-level constants should be in ALL_CAPS format\n",
    "    - Instance methods in classes should use `self` as the name of the first parameter (which refers to the object)\n",
    "    - Class methods should use `cls` as the name of the first parameter (which refers to the class)\n",
    "- Expression and Statement:\n",
    "    - Do: `if a is not b`, don't: `if not a is b`\n",
    "    - Do: `if not somelist`, don't: `if len(somelist) == 0`\n",
    "    - Do: `from bar import foo`, don't: `import foo` ???\n",
    "    - Avoid single-line if statement, for and while loops, and except compound statements. Spread these over multiple line for clarity\n",
    "    - Always put `import` statements at the top of a file\n",
    "    - Imports order: standard library modules, third-party modules, your own modules. Each subsection should have imports in alphabetical order\n",
